## silly intro
this is coming from the perspective of a person who produces very rudimentary edm tracks; yubuco. so, my knowledge is obsolete to anyone who wants to learn music production so when reading this think of it as you're reading condescendingly to a puny little girl who uhhhhh doesn't really know much abt edm

## the actual juice of the blog
can i say that like together forever my lovely lovely video game cartridges is literally the best heart of android song along with the titular song crystallized being the best in its album.. idkk don't flame me for this but i love those two songs.. i heard crystallized as the first camellia song of my life and i fcking loved itttt. that song *stuck* with me and it made such a huge impression. i listened to the song when i was a little kid and i had no concept of the fact that downloading songs off of mp3juice.com was a bad thing but like i listened to the song a lot after transferring to my ipod's (yes it was an ipod mini) 
itunes thing with syncios (if i remember correctly).. like it stuck with me and i listened to it falling asleep on loop a lot. fast forrward years later i downloaded osu!mania bc i was an fnf fan (still am but i like to stay away from drama bc people can be creepy and mean :c) and used the fnf skin a lot.. i remember the first camellia song i dpownloaded (obviously) was crystallized but it was that one where the background was silver with a little badge in the middle with the name crystalized, and i'm pretty sure it's like 5-6 stars or something I WAS AN FNF PLAYER I COULDN'T PLAY IT. oh yeah osu!mania made me listen to my next camellia song i discovered called quaoar (love that song too) and it amde me play teh camellia fnf mod (love that mod) and then i started listening to him more and more and more and more and more and more and now (along with snail's house and taku inoue. genuinely came, uji, and taku are my genuine biggest inspirations and my fav producers of all time i love them so much i want to pat all of them)
